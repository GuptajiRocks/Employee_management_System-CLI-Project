This is the Github Repository of Arihant Gupta and Ashutosh Asthana for the IP Project 2021 Term 1

The Source Code Zip needs to be downloaded from the release and before running the program the following python libarires must be installed via the 'pip' command in cmd.

1. Pandas (pip install pandas)
2. Numpy (pip install numpy)
3. Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
